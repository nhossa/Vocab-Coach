# 🎓 Vocab Coach — AI-Powered Technical Learning Platform

> A production-ready full-stack application demonstrating modern DevOps practices, cloud architecture, and AI integration.

**Live Demo:** *[Coming Soon - AWS Deployment]*

Vocab Coach is a cloud-native microservice that helps engineers master technical vocabulary across DevOps, Cloud, Backend, Networking, System Design, and Security. Built as a portfolio project showcasing real-world production patterns and AWS cloud infrastructure.

## 🎯 Project Highlights

- **Full-Stack Application**: FastAPI backend + responsive vanilla JavaScript frontend
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for intelligent answer grading and term validation
- **Production-Ready**: Docker containerization, environment-based configuration, structured logging
- **Cloud Architecture**: Designed for AWS deployment (ECS, RDS, S3, CloudWatch)
- **Security**: JWT authentication, rate limiting, input validation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM, 322+ pre-seeded technical terms
- **DevOps**: Infrastructure as Code ready, CI/CD pipeline prepared

## Features
### Technical Learning Engine

Provide any technical term (DevOps, SWE, System Design, Network, Security).

Returns a clean definition + simplified explanation.

Includes real-world engineering examples.

Stores terms to a user’s vocabulary list for spaced review.

### AI-Powered Quizzing

Users pick a category.

Service selects a random term from PostgreSQL.

User explains the concept in their own words.

AI evaluates the explanation against the ideal answer:

Score (0–100)

Strengths

Weak points

Correct definition

Weak terms are automatically saved for later review.

## Backend Architecture

FastAPI async endpoints

SQLAlchemy ORM with relationships

RDS PostgreSQL

JWT authentication + user scoping

CRUD endpoints for users, terms, vocabulary, quiz attempts

Background tasks for analytics + CloudWatch metrics

Optional Redis caching layer

Clean separation of routers, services, and models

Cloud & DevOps Stack

Docker containerization

ECS Fargate deployment

RDS PostgreSQL

S3 for term datasets

IAM least-privilege roles

CloudWatch logs + metrics

CloudTrail auditing

GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

Optional Terraform modules

This project intentionally mirrors real microservices used in production environments.

## Docker
- Build locally: `docker build -t tech-vocab-ai-coach:local .`
- Run locally: `docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_key> -e SECRET_KEY=<jwt_secret> -e ALGORITHM=HS256 tech-vocab-ai-coach:local`
- Pull and run (replace `<dockerhub-username>` with your account):  
  `docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_key> -e SECRET_KEY=<jwt_secret> -e ALGORITHM=HS256 <dockerhub-username>/tech-vocab-ai-coach:latest`
- API docs: open `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Health check: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Database: tables are auto-created and terms are auto-seeded on startup using SQLite `./vocab.db` (volume mount if you want persistence across container restarts).
